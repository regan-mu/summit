                        Summit Data Academy is a 21st century data school commited to improving the tech skills across the African continent.
                        Data has been dubbed the <b>"NEW OIL"</b> and  demand for Data Savvy professionals is projected to increase
                        tremendously over the next 10 years. Therefore we've taken on the responsibility to equip individuals
                        across Africa with the skills
                        necessary to analyze, manipulate and derive insights from massive amounts of data.
                        This will enable companies to make informed data-driven decisions.

                        goal is to ensure that this workforce has the relevant skills to not only compete in the world job market but also
                        in entrepreneurship and innovation.
